**Carbon Footprint Calculator :**
Calculate your carbon footprint and see how much you need to do to reduce it!
**carbon footprint :**
A carbon footprint is traditionally described as the total emissions created by an individual, event, organisation, or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents.


This calculator is designed for anyone who uses power and wants to know how much carbon footprint they make and how to reduce it. This is known as offsetting the carbon footprint. Of fact, power is only a small part of our overall carbon impact. However, if you eat a lot of it, you should consider taking action. Originally, the calculator was designed for cryptocurrency miners, who use a lot of electricity.

**Accuracy :**
The most important thing is to understand where your electricity comes from. Unless you have a completely self-sufficient source of electricity or have specific data from your electrical provider, you have no idea where it comes from.
We present a list of countries and their respective energy source percentages. However, some countries are very large, and the national average may be nowhere near where your electricity originates from. Furthermore, countries can purchase and sell power from other countries.
We also give median values for how much CO2 each power plant type emits. Again, these are the median (most "common") numbers for each power plant type.
